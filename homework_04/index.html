            <div class="intro">
                <p>
                    Modern rocket technology focuses on reusable launch systems,
                    like SpaceX's Falcon 9, to drastically lower costs, and the
                    development of super heavy-lift rockets, such as NASA's SLS,
                    for deep-space missions. Other advancements include lighter,
                    stronger materials like carbon composites, and cutting-edge
                    electric and nuclear propulsion systems that will increase
                    spacecraft speed and efficiency for long-duration missions.
                    Experimental methods, like SpinLaunch's kinetic launch
                    system, offer fundamentally new ways to reach orbit

            <h2 class="ktech">Key technologies and concepts</h2>

            <h3 class="reuse">Reusable Rockets</h3>
            <ul class="info-1">
                <li>How it works: Rockets like the SpaceX Falcon 9 are designed
                    to recover and reuse their most expensive components after
                    launch, significantly reducing the cost of space travel
                </li>

                <li>Benefits: Cheaper satellite deployment, expanding services
                    like communications and weather forecasting, and making
                    interplanetary exploration more economically feasible
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="super">Super Heavy-Lift Rockets</h3>
            <ul class="info-2">
                <li>Examples: NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) is a super
                    heavy-lift rocket capable of sending the Orion spacecraft,
                    astronauts, and large cargo to deep-space destinations like
                    the Moon.
                </li>

                <li>Purpose: To open new possibilities for human exploration and
                    robotic scientific missions far beyond Earth's orbit.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="advanced">Advanced Propulsion</h3>
            <ul class="info-3">
                <li>Electric Propulsion: Ion thruster systems use electric
                    fields to accelerate ions, providing high efficiency for
                    long-duration missions, though with lower thrust.
                </li>

                <li>Nuclear Propulsion: Research into using nuclear reactions to
                    accelerate spacecraft offers the potential for significantly
                    faster travel to distant parts of the solar system.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="novel">Novel Launch Methods</h3>
            <ul class="info-4">
                <li>Kinetic Launch Systems: Projects like SpinLaunch use a
                    large, rotating carbon fiber arm to accelerate a launch
                    vehicle to high speeds, providing an entirely new method for
                    reaching orbit.
                </li>

            </ul>
            <h3 class="innovative">Innovative Materials</h3>
            <ul class="info-5">
                <li>Lightweight Composites: The use of carbon composites and
                    other advanced materials is helping to create lighter, yet
                    stronger, rocket structures, which improves launch vehicle
                    performance
